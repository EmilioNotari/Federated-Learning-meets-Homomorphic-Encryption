# Homomorphic Encryption and Federated Learning based Privacy-Preserving: Breast cancer detection Use-Case

## Abstract

This project proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm for medical data using homomorphic encryption. The proposed algorithm uses a secure multi-party computation protocol to protect the machine learning model from the adversaries. In this study, the proposed algorithm using a real-world medical dataset is evaluated in terms of the model performance.
